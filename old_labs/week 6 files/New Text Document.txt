Lab Notebooks (see videos below)

All Notebooks use the same data set.

Data set --- >>> adult.csv

Demo Lab Notebook 1	--- >>> TU257-Lab6-Demo-1-Models(2).ipynb

Demo Lab Notebook 2 - Complete this notebook using the Algorithms from last week --->> TU257-Lab6-Demo-2-ROC.ipynb

Demo Lab Notebook 3 ---- >> TU257-Lab6-Demo-3-KFold.ipynb

After completing these notebooks and tasks, select another data set (see below for links to data sets), load this data set into a notebook and repeat the tasks for this new data set.
